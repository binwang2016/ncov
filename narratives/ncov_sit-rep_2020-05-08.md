# Executive summary

We analyzed 2,112 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes. By comparing these viral genomes to each other, we can characterize how COVID-19 is moving around the world and spreading locally. In this week's updates, we focus on recent spread across Asia. We report:

* Multiple introductions to Delhi during March 2020, rather than a single source (e.g., a widely scrutinized gathering)  
* Independent, unrelated outbreaks in other Indian states  
* Many separate introductions to Singapore, most of which do not appear to have spread further  
* Largely due to sociological factors, one introduction to Singapore has become a large outbreak among vulnerable communities of migrant workers  
* Similar patterns in other countries, emphasizing the inevitability of international spread and the urgent need for cooperative efforts

# [A note on sampling](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/XX/2020-05-06?c=country&r=country&d=map&p=grid&legend=closed)
We currently have sequences from samples taken in 26 countries in Asia. This is an incredible achievement -- sequencing an unknown, large RNA virus in the midst of a pandemic is difficult, and is only possible through the incredible work and timely sharing of data by scientists and physicians around the world.
<br><br>
While this data enables us to infer many useful characteristics of the outbreak and track its spread in real time, it's important to emphasize that our conclusions are limited by the available data.
<br><br>
For example, the map shows very few sequences from the Middle East. This is NOT because COVID-19 isn't circulating in these areas, or that these cases are not as crucial to understand; rather, we just don't have much data available from these areas. The size of each circle on the map indicates how much data is currently available from that area, rather than the true size of the outbreak.

# [Many separate introductions to Delhi during March](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-06?c=division&d=tree,map&dmax=2020-04-05&dmin=2020-03-01&f_country=India&f_division=Delhi&p=full&r=country)

A [series of religious gatherings in Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Tablighi_Jamaat_coronavirus_hotspot_in_Delhi) have received a great deal of scrutiny.
<br><br>
These gatherings lasted between March 1 -- March 24. Between March 1 -- April 8 (2 weeks after the gathering), 16 viral genomes from the Delhi area were sampled and sequenced.
<br><br>
If these gatherings were the sole hub of onward transmission in Delhi, we would expect to see only a few, large clusters of cases, consistent with a few infected individuals joining the gathering and spreading the virus to other attendees.
<br><br>
Here, though, we see cases scattered across the tree. This means that these cases were the result of many different introductions from all over the world.
<br><br>
This does not preclude the amplifying effect of large gatherings, but it does show that there were many separate introductions, from multiple sources, to Delhi during this time period.

# [Many cases in India are not necessarily linked to Delhi](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-06?c=division&d=tree&f_country=India&f_division=Delhi,Karnataka&label=clade:A2&m=div&p=full&r=division)

This is also true of other Indian states. Here, we see samples from Karnataka and from Delhi. The samples from Karnataka form two separate transmission chains, but each of these clusters is much more closely related to samples from other countries than to those from Delhi.
<br><br>
As always, we can't preclude the possibility that there were unsampled, intermediate cases, but this again demonstrates that the outbreak in India is the result of many separate introductions from all over the world, rather than just one hotspot.

# [Outcome of introductions to Singapore determined by sociological factors](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-06?d=tree,map&dmin=2020-02-26&f_country=China,Singapore,India,Philippines&p=full&legend=closed&r=division)

In the last 10 weeks, SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced to Singapore many times, from multiple locations. On the tree, this looks like a color change between a sampled case ("tip") and its ancestor ("internal node").
<br><br>
Most of these introductions have led to limited onward transmission (single cases or small clusters on the tree).
In the middle of the tree, we see a single introduction that led to a very different outcome, with extensive onward transmission.
This large, cohesive cluster is most closely related to samples from India and the Philippines.
<br><br>
This is consistent with recent [findings from classical epidemiology](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/28/world/asia/coronavirus-singapore-migrants.html) that the virus is spreading rapidly among confined populations of vulnerable migrant workers.
<br><br>
This clearly illustrates how sociological factors intersect with epidemiology and the importance of protecting vulnerable populations.

# [Regional transmission across Asia](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/asia/2020-05-06?f_country=Malaysia&d=tree,map&r=division)

We have 14 sequences from Malaysia on Nextstrain, sampled between January 28 and March 20. These sequences nest among several different clades circulating predominantly in other Asian countries during the same time period, suggesting that there have been multiple introductions into Malaysia from the surrounding region.
<br><br>
This pattern is repeated for many other countries in the region: multiple introductions, many well-contained by isolation, with a few that take off to spark local transmission. We encourage you to "Explore the Data Yourself"; you'll observe similarly scattered introductions into Jordan, Japan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.
<br><br>
The consistency of this pattern is strong evidence that no country can single-handedly combat COVID-19: viruses do not respect international borders. Rather, international and regional collaboration will be required to contain the pathogen long-term.

# [What you can do](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-05-06?c=country&d=map&p=full)
#### ...as an individual
* Practice strict social distancing, especially if you are in a vulnerable group.
* Remember that even if you are not super vulnerable, many people around you are; follow these practices to protect others.
* Wash your hands "like you just chopped a jalapeno and have to change a contact lens."  
* Stay home as much as possible -- especially  if you are sick; be prepared with extra supplies in case you need to self-quarantine.  
* If you are an employer, encourage your employees to work from home wherever possible.

#### ...as an official  
* Make testing free and broadly available.  
* Put strong social distancing measures in place.  
* Fund and implement extensive contact tracing efforts.  
* Financially support those impacted by social distancing measures.

# Takeaways

#### The outbreak in India is the result of many separate introductions, rather than a single gathering.  
<br><br>
#### In Singapore, sociological factors drove one introduction -- among many -- to become a large outbreak in vulnerable communities of migrant workers.
<br><br>
#### Most countries' outbreaks have a similar history: many separate introductions, some of which resulted in local spread. This pattern of multiple introductions over time emphasizes the need for international and regional cooperation to fully control the pandemic.
